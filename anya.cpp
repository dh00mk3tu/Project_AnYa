Descp

    AnYa is being developed by dh00mk3tu with the aim 
    to make it a system monitoring AI and to help achieve 
    our daily tasks faster and precisely. AnYa is currently 
    in second generation of it's life cycle. The original 
    was created in C++ and was very limited in terms of 
    library support. 
    
    This is second generation of AnYa initiated in September 
    2018. AnYa was re written from scratch in Python 3.x so 
    as to support wide variety of features which were planned 
    to be implemented using C++
    
    AnYa shall remain a terminal based, CLI program for long 
    and a system embedded version or a web browser based version 
    is far from seeing light
    

Version Nomenclature 
 
    Version Nomenclature in AnYa follows the following pattern 
    
    Generation.update.times_updated 
    
    The generation refers to the current active generation of AnYa
    The update refers to the version when a new feature was introduced.
    times_updated refers to the number of times the previous version was 
    appended with a change. 
    
    For Example; AnYa is currently in generation 2. Last feature 
    that was introduced was eye tracking, numbered 4. Times the 
    previous feature was update is one. So, the latest version of
    AnYa is 2.4.1 or simply 2.x
    


Future Updates 

    Here's a list of features which may see the light in the future updates
    1. Cursor with eyes
    2. Automated Cursor 
    3. Automated netstat
    4. face recog
    5. Encrypted protection to access AnYa 
    6. Chat Bot
    7. File cleanup automated
